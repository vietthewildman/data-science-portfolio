# Data Science Portfolio by Viet NPH
This repository is a front-page of my data-science portfolio with an overview of the projects I've worked on. Each project's `README.md` will provide a full description of the project, so I'll provide a short description here for convenience. 
Some projects contain private data, so its input dataset will not be public.<br/>
<sub>All of these projects are in Python</sub>

## PREDICTION MODELS

### Handwritten Digit Recognization (KAGGLE COMPETITION)
[Digit Regconizer Challenge with MNIST digit handwritten dataset](https://github.com/vietthewildman/kaggle-competition-digit-regconizer)<br/>
The project is to recognize a handwritten digit. Besides the model with more than 98% accuracy, I have also deployed a webapp using Streamlit for a quick interaction.

### Predicting Diabetes
[Diabetes predictions with the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset](https://github.com/vietthewildman/diabetes-prediction)</br>
The dataset contains 768 records of female Pima Indians health metrics, along with a label indicating whether the patient developed diabetes within five years of the initial measurement. The project is to create a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that can predict whether a patient is at risk of diabetes. 

### Predicting Taxi Fares
[NYC taxi fares prediction](https://github.com/vietthewildman/NYC-taxi-fares-prediction)</br>
With the rise of Uber, the Taxi and Limousine Commission of NYC needs to create a new app that allows commuters to book a yellow cab from their phones. The app provides fare pricing upfront before they hail a cab using their historical dataset as well as CNN.

### Cats Versus Dogs - Image Classification


### Removing Noise from Images


### Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
[The IMDb movie reviews prediction](https://github.com/vietthewildman/the-movie-DB-reviews-prediction)</br>
This project will use Long-short Term Memory model to predict whether a review on the IMDb is positive or negative. 

### Facial Recognition System


### Financial Solvency Predictions
[financial solvency predictions](https://github.com/vietthewildman/fintech-financial-solvency-predictions)
This project will use logistics regression to decided if we should proceed the loan from a particular user's demand, based on the user's demographic data.
