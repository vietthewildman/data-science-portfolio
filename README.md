# Data Science Portfolio by Viet NPH
This repository is a front-page of my data-science portfolio with an overview of the projects I've worked on. Each project's `README.md` will provide a full description of the project, so I'll provide a short description here for convenience. 
Some projects contain private data, so its input dataset will not be public.<br/>
<sub>All of these projects are in Python</sub>

## PREDICTION MODELS

### Handwritten Digit Recognization (KAGGLE COMPETITION)
[Digit Regconizer Challenge with MNIST digit handwritten dataset](https://github.com/vietthewildman/kaggle-competition-digit-regconizer)<br/>
The project is to recognize a handwritten digit. Besides the model with more than 98% accuracy, I have also deployed a webapp using Streamlit for a quick interaction.

### Predicting Diabetes
[Diabetes predictions with the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset](https://github.com/vietthewildman/diabetes-prediction)</br>
The dataset contains 768 records of female Pima Indians health metrics, along with a label indicating whether the patient developed diabetes within five years of the initial measurement. The project is to create a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that can predict whether a patient is at risk of diabetes. 

### Predicting Taxi Fares
[NYC taxi fares prediction](https://github.com/vietthewildman/NYC-taxi-fares-prediction)</br>
With the rise of Uber, the Taxi and Limousine Commission of NYC needs to create a new app that allows commuters to book a yellow cab from their phones. The app provides fare pricing upfront before they hail a cab using their historical dataset as well as CNN.

### Cats Versus Dogs - Image Classification


### Removing Noise from Images


### Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
[The IMDb movie reviews prediction](https://github.com/vietthewildman/the-movie-DB-reviews-prediction)</br>
The problem with sentiment analysis is vanishing gradient. At the moment, there are several models that can deal with this problem pretty well. With the dataset of movie reviews provided by the IMDb, I will will use Long-short Term Memory model to predict whether a review on the IMDb is positive or negative. 

### Facial Recognition System


### Financial Solvency Predictions
[Financial solvency predictions](https://github.com/vietthewildman/fintech-financial-solvency-predictions)</br>
This project will use logistics regression to decided if we should proceed the loan from a particular user's demand, based on the user's demographic data.

## DATA MINING

### Movies Information using The Movie DB API
[The-IMDb-movie-API-data-crawling](https://github.com/vietthewildman/the-IBMb-movie-reviews-crawling)</br>
The IMDb movie is one of thousands of platforms providing APIs to connect with their data collection. In order to understand what is the benefit and how to use APIs to crawl data, I create this project to enhance my knowledge on using API for Data Mining. 
                                                                                                       

### Real-estate from Propzy.vn using Scrappy
[Real-estate data crawling with Scrappy](https://github.com/vietthewildman/real-estate-propzy-using-scrappy/)</br>
The website contains thousands of real-estate data from Hochiminh city, Vietnam. Each data coming with location, price as well as facilities of the property.
