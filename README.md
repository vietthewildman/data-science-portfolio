# Data Science Portfolio by Viet NPH
This repository is a front-page of my data-science portfolio with an overview of the projects I've worked on. Each project's `README.md` will provide a full description of the project, so I'll provide a short description here for convenience. 
Some projects containing private data, so its input dataset will not be public.
_All of these projects are in Python._
